** The Life and Times of Sherlock Holmes **

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's celebrated Sherlock Holme's characters have captured the minds of countless admirers - young and old - over the years.

A fictional private detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning. His powers of deduction border on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.

Holmes has lived a life beyond the printed page. Recent adaptations, brought to life on the silver screen, include: Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman's portrayal in 'Sherlock'; Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal in 'Mr Holmes'; and - more recently - Will Ferrell and John C Reilly's portrayal in 'Holmes & Watson'.

Conan Doyle's writing lives on from generation. As Scott Monty - a member of the Sherlock Enthusiastic Group 'Baker Street Irregulars' - puts it:

> Every generation or so, some kind of cycle happens, some big book or movie begins to start the process and then others seem to follow up.
